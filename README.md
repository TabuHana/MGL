# [MGL - MyGamesList](https://mgl-mern.herokuapp.com/)

### Description

This site is a personal project I worked on during my coding bootcamp with my classmates. Its purpose is to help people find games based on specific genres and favorite them to view later.
I am currently re-designing the site with the goal of making the sites design more modern, integrating state, and changing the sites API.
